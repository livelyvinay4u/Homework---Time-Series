    "#### Time-Series Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the results of the Time Series analysis and modelling to answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plotting the Settle price to check for long or short-term patterns.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    * Do you see any patterns, long-term and/or short?\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a non stationary time series. Canadian Dollar vs Japanese Yen exchange price hit lowest in year 1995 and since then \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Decomposition using a Hodrick-Prescott filter (decompose the settle price into trend and noise).\n",
    "    \n",
    "     *  Do you see any patterns, long-term and/or short?\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Canadian Dollar vs Japanese Yen Exchange price is not smooth. Noise is distributed around zero mean with some irregular big spikes between 2008 - 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Forecasting returns using an ARMA model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Based on the p-value, is the model a good fit?\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the p value, moving average(MA) is significant but insignificant for autoregressive (AR) lag2. Basically significant autocorrelation exists between AR1 and MA1 values and hence predict looks right. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Forecasting the exchange rate price using an ARIMA model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * What does the model forecast will happen to the Japanese Yen in the near term?\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "P value is greater than 0.05. Forcast suggest exchange rate will drop meaning Japanese Yen will trade at increased price.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Forecasting volatility with GARCH.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    * What does the model forecast will happen to volatility in the near term?\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Analysis** \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the results of the completed time series analysis and modelling to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**\n",
    "Because Japanese Yen is increasing and volatility is not very irregular, I think I would buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think risk of Yen is expected to decrease as it's exchange price will increase and suggest somewhat regular volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I can apply need to practise and assess the model's outcome more, to gain comfortness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Regression Forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the results of the Linear Regression analysis and modelling to answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does this model perform better or worse on out-of-sample data compared to in-sample data?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower value of RMSE suggests better fit. So Out of sample performs better."
